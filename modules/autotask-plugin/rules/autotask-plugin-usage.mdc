# AutoTask Plugin Usage

Guidelines for using the AutoTask plugin in Cursor IDE.

## Connectivity Check

Before using AutoTask features, verify connectivity by:
1. Attempting to call an AutoTask MCP tool (e.g., `list_tasks`)
2. If the call succeeds, the server is reachable
3. If it fails, check that:
   - AutoTask API is running on `http://localhost:8000` (or configured URL)
   - MCP bridge is properly configured in `.cursor/mcp.json`
   - Bridge dependencies are installed (`cd bridge && uv sync`)

## Start Building Features Workflow

When the user requests to "start building features":

1. **Check Connectivity**: Use `list_tasks` with minimal parameters to verify connection
2. **List Open Tasks**: Get available tasks with `status=open`
3. **Select Task**: Choose the highest priority unblocked task
4. **Begin Work**: Update task status to `in_progress` and start implementation

## Best Practices

- Always verify connectivity before attempting operations
- Handle connection errors gracefully with helpful messages
- Prioritize unblocked tasks when selecting work
- Update task status appropriately as work progresses
